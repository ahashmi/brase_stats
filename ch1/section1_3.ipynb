    "> **Note**: in general, software based random number generators perform _sampling with replacement_. This means that although a number is selected for the sample, it is not removed from the population. It is possible for the same number to show up more than once in the sample. If _sampling without replacement_ is needed, simply generate more numbers than required and remove the duplicates.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A **SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLE** of _n_ measurements is a subset of the population selected such that every sample of size _n_ from the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "* A **SIMULATION** is a numerical facsimile or representation of a real-world phenomenon.\n",
    "* A **SAMPLING FRAME** is a list of individuals from which a sample is actually selected.\n",
    "* **UNDERCOVERAGE**: results from omitting population members from the sample frame.\n",
    "* A **SAMPLING ERROR** is the difference between measurements from a sample and corresponding measurements from the respective population.\n",
    "* A **NONSAMPLING ERROR** is the result of poor sample design, sloppy data collection, faulty measuring instruments, bias in questionaires, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RANDOM SAMPLING**: Use a simple random sample from the entire population\n",
    "* **STRATIFIED SAMPLING**: Divide the population into distinct subgroups called _strata_ based on a specific characteristic. Draw random samples from each stratum.\n",
    "* **SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING**: Assign sequential numbers to all members of the population. From a random starting point, include every _kth_ member in the sample.\n",
    "* **CLUSTER SAMPLING**: Divide population into pre-existing segments or clusters (often geographic). Make a random selection of clusters and include every member of each cluster in the sample.\n",
    "* **MULTISTAGE SAMPLING**: Use a variety of sampling methods to create successively smaller groups at each stage. The final sample consists of clusters.\n",
    "* **CONVENIENCE SAMPLING**: Create a sample by using data from  population members that are readily avaiable. (similar to observational studies?)"

You want a sample size of 100. Some sampling techniques are described below. Categorize each technique.  \n",
